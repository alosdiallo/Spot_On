# Spot_On
'SpotOn?' is an automated colony-quantification program that greatly increases the throughput of assessing positive colonies, and hence that of identifying interacting transcription factors. Currently Spot-On is designed to work with 1536 colony yeast plates, and is setup to detect how blue a colony is, but this can be altered to any size plate and any color easily. It was developed and is maintained by Alos Diallo.
